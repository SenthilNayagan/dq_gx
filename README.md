Data quality evaluation using great expectations OSS.

## Expectation Suite

- An Expectation Suite is a *collection of verifiable assertions* about data.
- Once the Expectation Suite is created, it goes through an iterative loop of Review and Edit as the team's understanding of the data described by the suite evolves.
- Expectation Suites are largely managed automatically in the workflows for creating Expectations. When the Expectations are created, an Expectation Suite is created to contain them.
